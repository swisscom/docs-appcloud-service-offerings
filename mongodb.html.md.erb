## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json
{
  "mongodb-2": [
    {
      "credentials": {
        "host": "kubernetes-service-node.service.consul",
        "ports": "52181,34278,31026",
        "username": "QkHWHmwkale0D90p",
        "password": "l9uGWEC6xZmiL7KG",
        "database": "c052a0cq",
        "database_uri": "mongodb://QkHWHmwkale0D90p:l9uGWEC6xZmiL7KG@kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:52181,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:34278,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:31026/c052a0cq?replicaSet=rs_ca5200la-6v2f-12ch-ab72-c8d8g79630bc",
        "uri": "mongodb://QkHWHmwkale0D90p:l9uGWEC6xZmiL7KG@kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:52181,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:34278,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:31026/c052a0cq?replicaSet=rs_ca5200la-6v2f-12ch-ab72-c8d8g79630bc",
        "replica_set": "rs_ca5200la-6v2f-12ch-ab72-c8d8g79630bc"
      },
      "label": "mongodb-2",
      "name": "mongodb-example",
      "plan": "small",
      "tags": [
        "mongodb"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<p class="note">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Please be aware that the number of concurrent connections to MongoDB is limited depending on the service plan you chose. You can manage this by using connection pooling.

## <a id='administrating'></a> Administrating your MongoDB instances

To connect to a running MongoDB instance with your local development tools, you can use the [`cf ssh`](../devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html) feature of the cf CLI:

- Create a local hosts entry
`127.0.0.1 localhost kubernetes-service-node.service.consul`

- Connect to an app in your mongodb space via cf ssh to forward the ports of all replicaSet slaves
`cf ssh myapp -L 40613:kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:40613 -L 46584:kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:46584 -L 38656:kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:38656

- Modify connection string (from 'cf env') and connect via mongo cli
`mongo mongodb://USER:PASSWORD@kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:40613,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:46584,kubernetes-service-node.service.consul:38656/d55a188e`

## <a id='version-upgrade'></a> Version Upgrade

New versions of MongoDB will be announced in the newsletter as soon as they are available.

The upgrade to the new version is done through the CF CLI by running the update service command. This command will always upgrade the binaries to the lastest available version.

`cf update-service <service-instance-name> -c '{"featureCompatibilityVersion":"3.6"}'`

You can only upgrade the service and change the feature compatibility to the new version.

## <a id='specifications'></a> Specifications

Our [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/community) offering consists of 3 Kubernetes containers configured as a replica set.

You will receive the role `clusterMonitor` on the admin DB, and the roles `readWrite` and `dbAdmin` on your DB.

## <a id='bestpractices'></a> Best Practices for Developers

- Write concern 2

  Please read [Replica Set Read and Write Semantics](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/replication). We recommend a "Write Concern" of `2` in order to ensure data consistency at all times, even if the replica set temporarily consists of just 2 nodes e.g. during system maintenance.

- Use an application driver maintained by the MongoDB team

  It’s critical to find a driver that [is well maintained](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/) and stays up to date with the latest MongoDB features.

- Index early and often

  Without question, the most common database performance issue is improper indexing (or a complete lack thereof). Have a look at the [Indexes manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/).

- Consider a query timeout

  MongoDB targets operations for termination if the associated cursor exceeds its allotted time limit. See [cursor.maxTimeMS()](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.maxTimeMS/) for more details.

## <a id='warnings'></a> Warnings

In accordance with the service plan you choose from the marketplace, resource limitations are enforced. Please note that exhausting those limitations comes with certain risks, and MongoDB itself only has very limited means of preventing overload / overuse.

- Memory

  If a replica set member of your MongoDB service instance exhausts the available memory, its `mongod` process will be killed and restarted. Luckily, the MongoDB replica set and MongoDB driver will mitigate this efficiently and without any noticeable downtime by default. However, your experience might degrade if the load isn't reduced and this keeps happening repeatedly within a short time frame. Furthermore, backup and restore operations (both system- and user-driven) might be impacted if the replica set is not running stably. Lastly, opening connections requires approximately 1 MB of memory, i.e. it might not be possible to open additional connections, once memory is exhausted.

- Storage

  If a replica set member of your MongoDB service instance runs out of disk space, its `mongod` process will crash and likely not be able to recover automatically. Additionally, there's an increased risk of data corruption if this happens.

- Connections

  The maximum number of connections provided with the service plan is not technically enforced, but must be adhered to anyway. If the maximum of connections is exceeded, proper operations can't be guaranteed anymore. This is particularly true for the service health and availability, as well as backup and restore operations (both system- and user-driven).
